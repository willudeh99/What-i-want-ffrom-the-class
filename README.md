# What-i-want-ffrom-the-class
Short paragraph
From what Iâ€™ve read so far, from all the pre-work, I want to learn as much as I can. Knowing that I am going to be using my laptop for many hours, I want to become better at typing, my goal being 65 words per minute. I want to learn how to use all the programs (python etc..) and really figure out how to apply them to the financial/business industry. I want to make it where its almost second nature to me use these programs.  I also want to learn how to really sell myself when looking for jobs in the industry. I am really looking forward to the blockchain and cryptocurrency modules. I do not know what either is about, but it sounds like learning a different way money moves nationwide, and that is interesting. And lastly, I am looking forward to the finance section of the bootcamp. For me, that seems like the core skill to learn. All the tools we are learning here are used to help better understand how to interpret and display financial models, financial analysis, and hopefully leading the company I work for in the future in the right direction. So a lot to learn, but I feel good that I am getting the chance to learn it.
